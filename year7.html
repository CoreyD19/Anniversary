      <h2>Year 7:</h2>
      <p>
        This year was the longest roller coaster we have ever seen. Starting off in a new place, away frm our routine, obstacles we could not forsee being thrown our way. But We hit the bottom of the hill and started that climb back up to the top, we grew individually and together for the first time in a while, reaching what felt like fresh air at the top that we hadn't felt in years. And then the cart went off the tracks in January. What we thought was the bottom before flew past us on our decent down. The intial crash and the fallout afterwards very well could have been the end of us. However, here we are 6 months later right back on that uphill climb, and i'm not stopping until we reach the stars this time.
